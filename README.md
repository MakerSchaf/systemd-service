# systemd-service

This _systemd-service_ script simplifies the task of creating a proper
_systemd_ service to run a (e.g. Raspberry Pi) project on system
startup.

See autostart-a-service.md for the documentation or run

    $ ./systemd-service

Do **not** install the script in a system directory like _/usr/bin_ or
similar.  The script should always be stored in your project's main
directory.
